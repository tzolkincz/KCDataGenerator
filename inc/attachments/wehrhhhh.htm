<p>Consider the following scenario: </p>

<p>Ruth is a senior manager in a government department. Her deputy, John, was one of the
applicants for the position she holds and he was very angry when he was not appointed.
John treats Ruth in a formal, unfriendly but polite manner. He carries out her
instructions precisely, but never does more than she explicitly tells him. </p>

<p>Ruth decides that the tension between them is destructive, both for her and for the
workplace, and decides to meet with John in an attempt to clear the air. Although he
agrees to the meeting, he insists that there is no problem, that his treatment or her is
entirely appropriate, and that he has no wish to have any sort of informal or personal
relationship with her. (Tillett 1997, 31) </p>

<p>How might Ruth communicate in her upcoming meeting with her deputy to reduce tension
between them? First, she would ask herself where it should take place? The physical
setting can help or hinder communication. His coming to her office would emphasize the
status difference and the related resentment already blocking communication. Her visiting
his office might seem contrived. As neutral and businesslike a setting as possible would
be recommended here. </p>

<p>Second, she would describe the tension she feels between them, and ask him what he
thinks might be done to reduce it. Such an approach might induce him to disclose more of
his own feelings. The &quot;I&quot; messages and active listening methods she would use
would tend to personalize their communication sufficiently but not to a degree that would
be uncomfortable for him. Finally, she might ask him to design a program for improving
communication generally in the department. In so doing, he would become a resident
specialist in it and a thus a deputy with special status. </p>
